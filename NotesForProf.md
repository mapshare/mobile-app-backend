# Notes For Prof

- Does the middleware server need to be hosted on the Seneca VM or can we use heroku?
- Does the MongoDB Databse need to be hosted on the Seneca VM or can we use mlabs?
- I cant figure out how to connect to the VM, what address do I use?
- I am not too familar with self hosting will we run into issues hosting possibly 2 databases and the middleware server?


- Node js setup on vm
    - you need to run the service code forever Ignore errors and restart client
    - one prerequisite node js port 10034 for node js there is a doc for ip update that with the port
    -
