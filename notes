Following Modules are required for this:
1) Express
2) Socket.io
3) EJS (Simple Templating language)


Notes:

While working on Socket.io, we are dealing with two files at the same time:
The server app file (e.g. index.js)

The client front-end file (e.g. index.ejs)

By using Socket.io, basically we are creating a “tunnel” between the server
and client with continuous real-time connection.
